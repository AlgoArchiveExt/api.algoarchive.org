## Overview
**AlgoArchive** is a Chrome extension that automatically grabs the LeetCode or HackerRank problem and its solution from the web page and pushes it to GitHub. The extension is designed to help users save and organize their submissions on GitHub, making it easier to track their progress and share their solutions with others.

This repository contains the REST API that the extension and web app use to perform the user-related tasks, like committing to users' repositories and by feeding it solution data.

## Development
1. **Setup:** 
    - Clone the repository: 
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/AlgoArchiveExt/api.algoarchive.org.git
      cd api.algoarchive.org
      ```
    - Install dependencies:
      ```bash
      go install 
      ```
2. **Run the development server:**
    - Using Air:
      ```bash
      # The air utility lets us to hot-reload the server
      # on filesave for faster and easier development.
      air
      ```
    - Or if you're traditional, use Make:
      ```bash
      # For first-time running
      make
  
      # Use after your first build
      make rebuild

      # Feel free to change the rebuild command to use 'clean'
      # or 'clean-windows', just don't push it please.
      # Any pull requests with it modified off Linux clean will be asked to fix it before merging.
      rebuild: clean-windows build run
      ```
3. **Test the server:**
    - First, see if your terminal gives you any errors.
    - Then, go to http://localhost:8080/api/health on your browser to see if your server is running correctly.
4. **Create or find an issue to solve:**
    - Feel free to look through the existing issues to find topics and discussions to contribute to.
    - When you're ready, create a branch and start working on it!
    - If there's something you found that doesn't work properly and there's no existing issues on it, feel free to start a discussion!
5. **Make a pull request for review:**
    - When you're done with your changes, start a pull request and add some people to review it. Feel free to add lausan3 or anyone who was in your discussion about your issue!
    - After all the proper checks and code reviews are completed and everything looks good to merge, squash and merge your commits following the commit guidelines below.

## Commit Message Guidelines & Conventions

To maintain consistency and clarity in our project’s commit history, please follow these guidelines for commit messages:

- **Type**: Specifies the type of commit being made. Common types include:
  - `feat`: New feature
  - `fix`: Bug fix or change (not as big in scope as a feature)
  - `docs`: Documentation changes
  - `style`: Code style updates (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
  - `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
  - `test`: Adding or modifying tests
  - `chore`: Other changes that do not modify routes or test files (e.g., updates to build scripts)

- **Scope**: Indicates the area or module affected by the commit. For example:
  - `endpoints`
  - `routes`
  - `controllers`
  - `utils`
  
- **Subject**: A concise description of the changes introduced by the commit.

**Format:**

```sh
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

**Descriptions**: You may also add a longer description under your commit as long as you separate it with two newlines.

```
feat(endpoints): add routing function for users route

I added a function for routing the users endpoints under /api/v1/users
```

**Examples:**

- `feat(controllers): add users controller`
- `fix(models): create problem schema model`
- `test(utils): add unit tests for route responses`
- `docs: update README with development instructions`
- `chore: update dependencies in package.json`
- `build: update webpack configuration for production build`
- `ci: add GitHub Actions workflow for linting`
- `perf: optimize websocket connection uptime`
- `revert: revert previous commit due to incorrect implementation`
- `merge: merge branch 'feature' into 'main'`
- `deploy: deploy to production server`

For more detailed information on commit message conventions, please refer to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).

**Optional:** You may use emojis to visually represent commit types (e.g., 🔥 for `feat`, 🐛 for `fix`, 📝 for `docs`, etc.).

#### File Naming Conventions

- Use `snake_case` for everything (e.g., `solutions.go`, `form_utils.go`).

## API Endpoints

All of the endpoints are under the ```/api``` directory.

#### List: 
- General:
  - ```GET``` Health ```/health``` Checks if the server is up and routing correctly. Just returns a "live": "ok" response if it's running properly.
- Solutions:
  - ```POST``` Commit Solution ```/v1/solutions``` - Commit a problem solution to a user's repository. As of right now, it doesn't matter if the user doesn't have the AlgoArchive App installed on their repository, we are going to implement this soon.
  - ```GET```  Get all Solutions ```/v1/solutions/:owner/:repo``` - Get all committed solutions from a user's repository.
